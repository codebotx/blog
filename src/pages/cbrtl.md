# What is cbrtl?

**cbrtl** is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers who like making fun
stuff and being involved in Open Source development. We are based out of Silicon Institute of
Technology, Odisha.

## What do we do here?
A lot of stuff, actually!

- **Create** *fun* and *unique* projects. Either in groups or in isolation.
- Organize community and online **showcases** for group and individual projects.
- **Contribute** to Open Source projects both in cbrtl and in other communities.
- Conduct **code reviews** and **JAM**s.
- Share lesser known **resources** to learn.
- Write blog posts about the eccentricities of everyday software. Ones that you wish you'd have found
  when starting out.

## What is the end goal?
Merely to promote Open Source culture and proper software development within our college.

## Where does cbrtl operate from?
Primarily, we are a bunch of students from Silicon Institute of Technology, Odisha.
The idea has been to promote the spirit of open source among our students. That said,
we are always open to having new members from anywhere.

## How far down the road are we?
Not that far, the egg has just been laid. As of the time of writing this post, we have just started out. Remember that cbrtl is an *attempt* at creating a place for people to forge software.
For the effort to work out, we are looking for active participation from *you*.

## What can I do?
Just what you've been doing so far, but with more people!

If you have projects that you have already been working on, let us know and we'll put them on the
cbrtl page for more people to see. 
Note that there is some criteria that projects must qualify, some of these are intentionally vague. 
But as long as you're doing more than following a course or tutorial, it's most likely going to be accepted :)

# Volunteering to cbrtl
We are looking for volunteers for some roles.
Note however, that there is no strict mandate for responsibilities.
As long as you're capable of adding *something* of value, no matter how small, shoot us a message!
We're looking for some help with:

- **Code reviewers**: If you have experience contributing to FOSS or writing code for user/developer
  facing products, perhaps you can volunteer and help us out here :)

- **Editors**: We plan on writing frequent blog posts. But both the technical content and the english
  material can use a second pair of eyes to help catch mistakes or inconsistent writing. If you have
  done some technical writing before, you can volunteer for reviewing the content in blog posts!

- **Technical Writers**: If you have experience writing code but are usually on a tight schedule, you
  may be able to join us and share your knowledge. We want to mandate a high quality in our posts, so any
  tutorial/how-to guide that has been done a million times before is generally discouraged. We want
  to avoid redundant topics like "How to build a todo app with React" and promote posts and dev-logs / 
  journals that are fun to read and explore.

- **Frontend devs**: Currently, the cbrtl website is bland and not-so-catchy.
  While minimalism is the core idea, we can definitely use some front-end developers to help keep the UI fresh, responsive and modern.

- **Moderators**: To help keep the community together on discord and github.

**NOTE** We do not expect any level of time commitment from volunteers, as long as you can make small
contributions, we appreciate it. That is what *volunteering* is after all :)

# The kind of software we want to write
We firmly believe in re-inventing the wheel.
Writing software close to the metal helps us closely understand the inner workings of tools we use
everyday and take for granted.
While any creative project is welcome, here are some ideas that adhere to the aforementioned:

- Compilers
- Virtual Machines and Interpreters
- Game Engines
- Operating Systems
- Search Engines
- Database engines
- Voxel renderers
- TCP/IP stack
- VCS

In short, we encourage all kinds of creative projects no matter how basic. But you can expect
the above group projects to come to life as the community grows. Remember that all of the above
is also regular software that we tend to take for granted which can be (and has been) written from scratch.

## Showcasing your project

[This](https://cbrtl.github.io/posts/project-showcase/) post has something to say about project showcases, so you can go read up on that.
If you want to showcase your project on our github org, then reach out to us on discord or the mailing list :)
